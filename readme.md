# GMT Spinner
## A multi-purpose loading widget for GMT web-apps  
I made it for the GMACS Exposure Time Calculator, but figured it might be useful for a variety of things. This isn't officially recognized by GMT, but you're welcome to use it for GMT applications if you'd like. Also, the dots may not necessarily be accurately placed. If anyone feels like doing the trig and submitting a pull request, that'd be welcomed.

In actual application, the fades are smoother. This is just a simple gif to demo it. You can also just clone/download this repository and open the `demo.html` file therein.
